              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Java programming</h6>
              <p id="article1" class="card-text">I share the view that java is a more than viable language to learn, with many applications and especially in terms of "learning" a language to begin with you have very great materials to start and the overall great IDE that is Eclipse which will give you a pretty good kick-start with many great and easily integrated plugins, all free (as i would not underestimate a good IDE if it comes to learning a language, it will boost the learning process by a lot).
              Like every language most problems regarding the language itself ground on the problem that the programmer itself demands a special behaviour they are allready used to and actual dont want to learn a different approach to solve that problem.
              For example, if you come from C++ into Java, you think you are "missing" a lot of stuff, like pointers, a destructor and you have to get used to how the garbage collection works (or even missuse it to further make your performance worse). Also, the enumeration class is quite different from how its used in C++ (were its incredible simplistic, while java packs a lot of functionality and features into enumerations). You can also learn a test-driven approach quite easily with Java, which is highly recommanded i might say, together with a clear pattern to use (like MVC) , so you dont even start to fall into bad habbits.
              That means, its quite easy to make yourself blind for the actual features that java provides, and using all this bad habbits from other languages, will put you into serious troubles in java, as the problems just carry on, they might not even be problems of java itself (especially in terms of security, if you are either lazy in what you programm, or you use way too strong bounds to a plattform, or very very bad habbits i know from a lot of C++ devs that they use a ton of global static values, especially String values that cause incredible problems in testing and java provides the features to avoid them, but they are just not used, as they simply took old C++ code and 1for1 ported that to java, easy to see that this wont be an improvement at all).
              But a good programmer will work with every language that is ment to solve the problem.
              Basic principles like Design patterns should be known.
              For that everyone has to get in touch with them quickly after learning the most basics, to avoid falling into the worst bad habbits, the actual "Anti-Patterns". Worst about them, you might feel like you are doing a great job, while in fact, you just work way too complicated, as the language allows for a much smoother solution, you might be blind to.
              So if the question really is : "Is Java worth learning it?" 
              The answer is a clear "Yes".
              But so is to learn multiple languages, just to get a hang for what a language provides and does best.
              If you are a programmer that can only use 1 language, you are not a good programmer, and you never will be.
              To make give a visual example. A car-mechanic will use the best tool to make a repair, they wont just use one for everything, so they have a bunch of tools to choose from and know them all good enough.
              That doesnt mean you will need a real expert in a language depending on a project, especially if it comes down to a serious performance issue, you have to go very deep into the details, but then, you are clearly the wrong person if you are just starting to learn a language anyway.
              My personal languages of choice to learn programming are C++ / Java and Python, so you get a good idea of different concepts, and they provide a fair deal of very good books and material to learn on specific examples, and you will find some great open source products aswell, which will aid you to get a hang on the language of your choice and make it easier to learn other languages from then on.
              In the end, the language doesnt really matter, as long as its a rich language that provides you enough room to fully explore a fair deal of Design patterns that will finally help you in every language you will use from then on.</p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">JavaScript programming</h6>
              <p id="article2" class="card-text">It is a funny and easy to use language, fully available in any browser with minimal differences, on any platform and with very good debuggers for front-end.I like it because it is a very fast interpreter, object-oriented in the same time.Objects are better (in JS) without classes as opposed to any other OO languages (that I know.) This allows a fast developing process since you do not have to modify a class in order to add a property or method to a particular object.Nice inheritance through prototype, nice lambda methods for arrays and other structures.It has a lot of good frameworks (jQuery, D3, Dojo (which I hate, but I deal with it,) Angular, React, Polymer, even Underscore and Prototype…)Lot of on-line resources and documentation, and easy to get inspired by the work of others in GitHub or directly from the source of Web pages.I think that back-end works better without it (Node.js) by using more compact (compiled) code. The same for front-end for small devices (mobile) where debuggers are not included in most browser (and would be difficult to use on the device,) but I would not give it for Java!On front-end, it mixes well with CSS3 and dom navigation (directly or through frameworks as jQuery.)In my opinion, it lacks tough structures and patters (although some frameworks - as Angular or D3 - still add them successfully,) but it is more an issue of the dom and not a big loss while balancing with the easy of development and deployment.</p>

              <p id="article3" class="card-text">C# is a very powerful language by Microsoft. I have personally working on it since many years. Good thing about it is whenever its new version comes up it does not overload the developer with lots of changes. For example Apple iOS used Objective C and now they brought Swift into the market. Now all iOS developers at some point need to make efforts to learn new language. But C# is always stable, familiar and will become more and more powerful for development. You can build all possible types of applications using C# windows, web based, service based, anything. It is huge market over the world covered by MS machines so my opinion is that it is really worth learning C#.Another thing is that C# is object oriented language. Once you know how to unleash its power then its not hard to learn other OO languages in the market, be it java or swift.</p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">C++ programming</h6>
              <p id="article4" class="card-text">I give a three star review, it would be a five star if this was about "what could have been, and almost was", and a one star review if it is "what it has become, and what the effect is". But I can't be too negative, because there are extremely significant ideas in there, which are implemented just slightly wrong, and that wrecks the development path. Everything everyone says about it is propaganda either for or against.If you ask me personally, "should I learn C++"? I would say "No. Learn C". But I would have to add that Bjarne Stroustroup is an extremely smart and honest fellow, and had a lot of new ideas for this, and spent a great deal of time making a language that should have worked, and it became a standard for such a long time, and did work in certain ways. So his ideas need to be understood and respected and internalized, even if you don't use the final product (which you shouldn't).What went wrong? How to fix it?I can only give opinions. I hoped to do something like this years ago, I wasn't sure if I was up to it, but I was going to give it a shot. But after doing some stupid preliminary exercizes I got distracted by an idea for describing biology, and did that instead. Biology is what we call computer programming when nature does it, so it was a natural segue.In my opinion, the downfall of C++ can all be traced to one decision: the implementation of virtual classes with a non-transparent virtual function table. That introduces that damn function table pointer!By doing this, the implementation has violated the principle that every data structure in C must be binary transparent, so you can look at its guts and debug it, and print it out, and change it. You can't do that for the function pointer table, it's a statically compiled object. There's no reason for this. If you take any class with virtual functions, and take the first 8 bytes of any instance, that's the address of the virtual function table, and if you go there, you find a list of function pointers waiting for you, which are your virtual functions. You can overwrite this stuff with new pointers if you like, it will clobber your code usually, but you can do it. Just it's not supported in the language itself.To fix this, all you needed to do was just make the virtual function table explicit:class froo { vtable * vtpr = {virtual function declarations}   ; data data data; functions functions functions }In this way, you don't need to make a special syntax. You can call the virtual functions explicitly through their vtable, using some syntax to make it easier. You can include more than one vtable, if the vtable has only one function, you can call it directly, the implementation is under YOUR control, not the standards committee. You can include concatenated vtables (for multiple inheritance) interleaved vtables, whatever the heck you want. And you can dynamically change the vtable when you add a new function. If C++ did something like this, I think it would have been a universal standard.But since it didn't, it became a sink for all the bad ideas that didn't make it to C. It got references (ridiculous), operator overloading (ridiculous and dangerous, it should be done differently), rewritten I/O (useless, stdio was much better), deprecated the preprocessor (bad idea). And by 1995, it gave a cause for free software to rally around--- the free software programmers were those programmers which didn't use C++. This included Stallman and Torvalds, but tragically, not the gcc committee, which switched to C++ a few years ago, thereby relegating them to obsolescence.There is a second thing wrong with C++, this is the philosophical idea present in C that code should be generated by code-generating programs, not written by humans. That was the point of Lex and Yacc, and all the Unix tools of the early 80s.  Now, if you need a C code, you can generate it and compile it with Perl.The C++ philosophy wants to do all this in the compiler, so you get inline functions and templates, both of which are nonsense. The inline functions are used for ridiculous over-encapsulation, like accessing members using functions instead of just by changing values. The templates are terrible, and make the compiler impossible to write except if you spend a year or two studying what the standards committee decided. It's no good.The solution here is to write a full meta-langauge for manipulating C code as first class objects, and have a Turing complete pre-processor, which puts together your code for you. This is the project I was interested in, to complete the definition of first class C code to the point where it would turn into a replacement for the template language of C++. I didn't do it. There are half-way steps in the recent CS literature, like backtick-C, which is C with first class code, and a recent C++ interpreter, where there is a C-like language which can be stored in a reasonable way. But the proper framework for manipulating C code isn't there, like in LISP, where your code is a list, except in C it's not a list, it's something else.</p>

              <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Python programming</h6>
              <p id="article5" class="card-text">I like it a lot. It’s by far my preferred language - both in terms of syntax and functionality. Since it is multi-paradigm, has an extensive standard library, and very quick to write, about 90% of my work is done with Python. It is well suitable as a default language - one of the few that I don’t just use as a tool.Aside from Python being great to get things done, there are some features I like a lot about it as a language:The core language is really simple. There are only a few concepts one must learn, anything else follows from it.
              Pure but expressive syntax. Avoids being as needlessly verbose as C++, while not having hidden magic happen like Perl. Some few, nice constructs such as comprehensions. No glyph voodoo.
              Sufficiently types. Dynamic variables are great for prototyping and code-reuse, with strongly typed objects avoiding most why-did-that-happens.
              Many very nice features. OO is great, with meta-classes, descriptors and the Data Model. Generators are a killer feature that I miss greatly in other languages. Decorators, closures, …
              Of course, Python is not perfect - far from it, actually. It’s strong point is that these shortcomings do not matter 95% of cases. Some are quite severe, and may be nails-in-the-coffing in the future.Concurrency is bad. The GIL is part of CPython, PyPy, Cython (i.e. the bulk of the ecosystem), making true multi-threading impossible. This is simply inappropriate today.
              PyPy is working on Transactional Memory, but is still far from done. CPython puts a severe restriction on non-GIL implementations, in that single-thread performance is not allowed to be degraded.
              Too dynamic for its own good. It is possible to overwrite so many things, the language is impossible to optimise classically with compiling. Even if 99% of code is “normal”, support for that 1% requires every step to be taken.
              Again, PyPy does some optimisations in this regard, falling back to unoptimised if assumptions do not hold. Some sort of restricted-mode, like other scripting languages have, could help Python as a whole, however.
              Quite far from the metal. You won’t get SIMD, HTM, branch prediction, and all the other modern nifty features. Having worked on caching a lot, I pity the CPU running my code.
              Sure, there is a lot more to say about such a language, but this is the gist of my stance on it. At the moment, I really don’t have another all-round language that can compete with Python..</p>

              <p id="article6" class="card-text">I think Ruby is a beautiful and artful language and yet practical and efficient, which is really impressive in my perspective.Ruby was created by the blend of many languages like Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It is a reflective, dynamic, general purpose and object-oriented language.In my opinion, Ruby is a very fun programming language to work with, It is concise which means it is somewhat similar to English hence making it a favorable choice for startups and coding beginners.It is a high-level abstract language, in simpler words, it handles most complex details for you.Ruby has become really popular after the Ruby on Rails framework came out and Ruby is widely used for the websites like Airbnb, Hulu, Kickstarter, and Github which has made it a fitting career option.Startup business is a huge thing in 2018 and there is a huge scope for you if you choose to learn Ruby Programming language.</p>
